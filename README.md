To generate an array of random numbers between 20 and 40, and calculate the occurrences of each unique number in the array, you can use the following C# code. This approach does not use a statically declared array, and ensures that each execution generates a different set of numbers.

**Code Explanation:**

•	Random Number Generation: The rand.Next(20, 41) generates random numbers between 20 and 40 inclusive, and fills an array numbers with 100 such random numbers.
•	Counting Occurrences: The GroupBy method groups the numbers by their value, and then the ToDictionary method creates a dictionary where the key is the number and the value is its count.
•	Output: The code outputs the occurrences of each unique number in the array.
